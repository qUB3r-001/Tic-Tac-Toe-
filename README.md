## About

The classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe made with React using hooks. For component styling Material-UI is used and for the rest part Bootstrap v5.0.

#### Player vs Player

• Player starting is randomly assigned either X or O.

#### Player vs Bot

• Bot always moves first because else the game would always result in a draw.
• Bot uses Minimax to calculate the best possible move by running through all possible games and maximizing its winning %.

GLHF ;)
